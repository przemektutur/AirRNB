## QUICKLY PREPARED PROGRAM FOR SHOW RNB PROJECT FOR LODGIFY ;)

Program predicts a price for one night in various location.
Three cities were added for prediction: London, Athens and Barcelona.
Data is taken from AirRNB.

### SORRY FOR NOT KEEPING OOP AND SPAGHETTI CODE - FAST CODING IN THE MORNING;)

I saw Lodgify is searching for machine learning/deep learning/AI engineer and

as a fast-growing company leading the vacation rental industry with innovative 

software... I thought to prepare in the morning short program which will calculate

rental prices. I didn't have much time before getting kids to kindergarten...

so program works, predicts, but for sure code should be cleared and change into OOP :)

### IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT MADE AS OOP - PLEASE LET ME KNOW
